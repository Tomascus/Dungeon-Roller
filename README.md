## Hidden Dungeon is a top-down dungeon crawler based. Your goal is to escape the dungeon through a hatch that is guarded by some ancient entity. As you move through rooms, you get locked and have to defeat the enemy ambushes.
### You have limited health and have to move strategically and have enough skill to kill the enemies and avoid death. There are keys which unlock the boss doors, which are guarded by elites with adjusted stats.

# TUTORIAL
## - Use arrow or WASD keys to move.
## - Move from left to right, the right path is always right.
## - Use the mouse to aim at the enemies.
